# Class Introduction

* Welcome to *Ultimate Rust: Foundations*. 
* This is a four-day class, taking you new to Rust (but probably familiar with other languages) to proficient in day-to-day Rust.
* Each day will be divided into four hours, with a 10-12 minute break at the end of each hour.
* Help me customize the class for you - please indicate your experience level with Rust in the Zoom poll I've setup.
