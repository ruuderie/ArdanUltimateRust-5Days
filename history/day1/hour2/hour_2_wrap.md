# Hour 2 Wrap

In this hour, you've learned:

* Create a basic Rust enumeration---a lot like other languages.
* Use simple `match` statements on the enumeration.
* Add data, included nested enumerations, to your enumeration branches.
* Derive `PartialEq`, `Clone`, and `Debug` to save typing and add properties to your types.
* Use complex `match` statements to handle complex data types.
* Implement associated functions and member functions on enumerations.
* Use *function pointers* to pass functions between functions.
* Create `struct` types to bundle data together.
* Implement functions on `struct` types.
* Create an array of structures.
* Return an array and *move* it.
* Pass an array to a function as a *slice*, so the recipient doesn't need to know the container type.
* Use *iterators* to process data types without resorting to loops.

# TIME FOR A BREAK
# COME BACK IN 12 MINUTES TO CONTINUE
## After the break, we're going to start to learn about vectors, hash maps, dependencies and serialization.
