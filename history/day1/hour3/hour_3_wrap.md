# Hour 3 Wrap

In this hour, you've learned:

* All about `Vec`, one of Rust's core containers.
* Using `HashMap`, and when its a good replacement for `Vec`.
* Serializing your data with `Serde` and `serde_json`.
* Loading your data back again.
* Securing passwords in serialized data with a hashing function.

# TIME FOR A BREAK
# COME BACK IN 12 MINUTES TO CONTINUE
## After the break, we're going to build a user management application.
