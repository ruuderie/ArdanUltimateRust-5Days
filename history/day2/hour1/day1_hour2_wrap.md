# Day 2, Hour 1 Wrap

We've covered:

* Organizing your code into modules.
    * The 3 ways to make a module:
        * The `mod` block.
        * A single file, imported with `mod <name.rs>;`
        * A directory containing a `mod.rs` file, imported with `mod <name.rs>;`.
* Handling Errors
    * Dealing with `Result` types.
    * Putting disparate error types in a `Box`.
    * Simplifying errors with `anyhow`.
    * Making better errors with `thiserror`.
    * Errors are NOT exceptions.
